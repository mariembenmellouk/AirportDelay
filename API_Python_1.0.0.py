    """
    create_airport_encoding is a function that creates an array the length of all arrival airports from the chosen
    departure aiport.  The array consists of all zeros except for the specified arrival airport, which is a 1.  

    Parameters
    ----------
    airport : str
        The specified arrival airport code as a string
    airports: dict
        A dictionary containing all of the arrival airport codes served from the chosen departure airport
        
    Returns
    -------
    np.array
        A NumPy array the length of the number of arrival airports.  All zeros except for a single 1 
        denoting the arrival airport.  Returns None if arrival airport is not found in the input list.
        This is a one-hot encoded airport array.
